Have you heard of the game "electrons around the cores"? 
I'm not allowed to give you the complete rules of the game, just so much:

The game is played with 4 to 6 dice, so you get an array of 4 to 6 numbers, 
each 1-6 the name of the game is important.

You have to return the correct number five times in a row and your solution 
is considered to be correct.

If you just press "submit", you'll get an array and the expected value!

Here are some input/output pairs for you to wrap your mind around:

[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] -> 6
[ 2, 2, 3, 3 ] -> 4
[ 6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3 ] -> 2
[ 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2 ] -> 12
